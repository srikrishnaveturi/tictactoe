# Tic-tac-toe is a very popular game, so let’s implement an automatic Tic-tac-toe game using Python.

### What we are going to do?

We are going to build a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which we can play in the command-line. Initially, we’ll make an empty game board 
and then we’ll take inputs from the players and we’ll check for the winning condition.

### What will we use?

We will build this game using Python 3, so make sure you have it installed on your laptop/computer and we are good to go.

### What we’ll learn?

After building this game, we can get a pretty clear idea about dictionaries in python, how to access dictionaries, 
how to iterate over dictionaries, for loop, if-else conditions and functions in python.

### How does the game work?

The board is numbered like the keyboard’s number pad. And thus, a player can make their move in the game board by entering the number from the keyboard number pad.
Make sure your Num Lock is off :)
